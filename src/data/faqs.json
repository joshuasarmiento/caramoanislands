    "question": "How do I get to Caramoan from Manila?",
    "answer": "As of 2026, direct land travel is the standard. <br><br>• Direct Bus: Take a bus from Cubao or PITX (Raymond Transport or Peñafrancia) directly to Caramoan Town. It takes 12–15 hours and costs ₱1,200–₱1,800. <br>• Via Naga (Air/Bus): Fly to Naga Airport or take a bus to Naga City. From the Naga North Terminal, take a direct van or bus to Caramoan via the Fuentebella Highway (3.5–5 hours). <br>• Note: The old route via Sabang Port is largely bypassed by tourists now due to the improved mountain highway which is safer and more reliable."

    "question": "What is the best time to visit Caramoan?",
    "answer": "Late January to April is the gold standard for 2026. <br><br>• Peak Season: March–May (Clear skies, but higher local crowds). <br>• Shoulder Season: November–January (Cooler weather). <br>• Avoid: June–October (Typhoon season). Bicol is directly in the typhoon path, and land travel can be delayed by landslides during heavy rains."

    "question": "Are there ATMs and stable internet?",
    "answer": "• ATMs: There are now ATMs in the town proper (Landbank/BDO/UCPB), but they frequently go offline or run out of cash. Carry 100% of your budget in cash.<br>• Signal: 4G/5G is reliable in the town center. On the islands, you will have no signal, making it a perfect 'digital detox' destination."

  {
    "question": "What is the best way to get around the town?",
    "answer": "The primary mode of transport in Caramoan town is the tricycle. <br>• A trip within the town center costs around ₱20–₱50. <br>• For trips to the ports (Bikal or Guijalo), tricycles can be chartered for ₱150–₱300 depending on the distance."

  {
    "question": "Do I need a tour guide for island hopping?",
    "answer": "Yes. Local ordinances require a registered guide for all boat tours. This ensures safety and helps preserve the marine environment. Most boat rentals already include a boatman, but a dedicated guide (₱500–₱700/day) is highly recommended for exploring lagoons and caves."
