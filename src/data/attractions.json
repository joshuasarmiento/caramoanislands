    "longDescription": "Matukad Island is the crown jewel of the Caramoan archipelago, distinguished by sand so fine and white it is often compared to Boracay's White Beach. The island's mystique centers on its landlocked 'Enchanted Lagoon.' To see it, travelers must scramble up a jagged 30-foot limestone wall. According to local folklore, the lagoon is home to a giant, solitary milkfish (bangus). Legend says there were once two, but after a family caught and ate one, they all perished, leaving the remaining fish as a lonely, mystical guardian. The island's geography features lush tropical greenery clashing against sharp karst formations, providing a dramatic backdrop for photography. It was also a key filming site for Survivor USA seasons.",

The island is essentially a spectacular sandbar sandwiched between two towering limestone cliffs. This unique geography allows travelers to walk from one side of the ocean to the other in just a few steps. It gained international fame as a primary challenge location for multiple seasons of the 'Survivor' TV series. Because of its lack of vegetation, it offers unobstructed sun and is a premier spot for swimming in crystal-clear turquoise waters.",

The water remains waist-deep for hundreds of meters, making it feel like a giant, natural infinity pool. It is widely considered the best 'chill-out' spot in the peninsula, offering a 360-degree view of the Pacific horizon.",

From this vantage point, travelers are treated to a breathtaking panoramic view where the Pacific Ocean meets the rugged coastline of neighboring Catanduanes.

Travelers must ascend a challenging 524-step concrete staircase to reach the summit. At the top stands a 26-foot statue of Our Lady of the Holy Rosary, Mother of Peace, which was inaugurated in 1990. Beyond its religious significance, the grotto offers the most comprehensive panoramic view of Caramoan.

Founded by Franciscan missionaries in 1619, the current structure was built using distinct red bricks and coral stones, a common architectural style during the Spanish colonial era in the Bicol region. The church is famous for its fortress-like appearance, designed to protect the local community from pirate raids that were frequent along the coast centuries ago. Inside, the church retains its solemn, ancient atmosphere with thick walls and preserved religious artifacts. It remains a primary pilgrimage site during the town's fiesta in May and serves as a reminder that Caramoan was a thriving community long before it became a world-class travel destination.",
