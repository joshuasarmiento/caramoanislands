        <div class="text-ocean space-y-4 leading-relaxed">
          <p>
            Caramoan’s story begins with a legend. The town was originally called <em>"Carahan,"</em> named after the
            sea turtles that once nested in abundance along its shores. Over centuries, as Spanish missionaries arrived
            in the early 1600s, the name evolved, but the deep connection to nature remained. You can still see this
            colonial footprint today in the <strong>St. Michael the Archangel Parish</strong> (founded 1619), a
            red-brick testament to the town's resilience against centuries of typhoons and pirate raids.
          </p>
          <p>
            For generations, Caramoan remained a "secret paradise" known only to locals and intrepid backpackers. That
            changed in the late 2000s when the global reality TV franchise <strong>Survivor</strong> discovered its
            rugged, untouched beauty. Hosting consecutive seasons for the <strong>US, France (Koh-Lanta), Israel,
              Serbia, and others</strong>, the islands were catapulted onto the world stage. Yet, despite the fame,
            Caramoan has miraculously kept its soul—remaining a sanctuary where nature, not commercialism, rules.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-ocean">Geography: The Edge of the Peninsula</h2>
        <div class="text-ocean space-y-4 leading-relaxed">
          <p>
            Located at the lower tip of Camarines Sur in the Bicol Region, Caramoan is not just a single island, but a
            jagged peninsula jutting out into the Pacific Ocean, surrounded by a scattering of limestone jewels. The
            landscape is dramatic—think towering karst cliffs that rival El Nido, but without the crowds.
          </p>
          <p>
            The geography here plays tricks on the eye. At <strong>Matukad Island</strong>, you’ll find a hidden lagoon
            guarded by a solitary, mythical milkfish (Bangus) that locals believe brings bad luck if harmed. At
            <strong>Lahos Island</strong>, the beach completely disappears at high tide, sandwiching you between two
            massive rock formations. From the sprawling sandbars of <strong>Manlawi</strong> to the subterranean rivers,
            the terrain is a playground for the adventurous. The best time to witness these wonders is during the dry
            season (March to May).

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-ocean">Culture: The Warmth of the "Oragon"</h2>
        <div class="text-ocean space-y-4 leading-relaxed">
          <p>
            To visit Caramoan is to experience the heart of Bicolandia. The locals, often described as <em>Oragon</em>
            (strong-willed, brave, and feisty), are deeply hospitable. Life here revolves around the rhythm of the
            tides. Most families still rely on fishing and agriculture, though eco-tourism has become a new source of
            pride.
          </p>
          <p>
            You cannot speak of the culture without mentioning the food. Bicolano cuisine is famous for two things:
            <strong>gata</strong> (coconut milk) and <strong>siling labuyo</strong> (chili peppers). Prepare your palate
            for rich dishes like authentic <em>Laing</em> (dried taro leaves in coconut milk) and the fiery <em>Bicol
              Express</em>. Here, a meal isn’t just sustenance; it’s a warm welcome offered with a smile.
